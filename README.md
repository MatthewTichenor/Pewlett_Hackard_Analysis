##Challenge Written Report

Part One

In this assignment we were task to create a new ERD and sql code to take data from Employee number,First and last name,Title,from_date,Salary and come up with numbers and files to reflect data. We use the date range of those who are born between '1952-01-01' and '1955-12-31' to find who can retire. In this also we also see who is qualify for mentorship and we are using the range between '1965-01-01' and '1965-12-31'. By this we can gather data and come up with answers.

Part Two

I created A ERD path to see the table where I would gather the information. I had problems with pathways and table showcasing the proper data. I had to debug but felt that the code written was the proper direction. Sql is very sensetive but with going back through the module was able to come up with code. VS code and pgAdmin4 were the tools I used to create the finish product.

Part Three

The data received was a lot. There is many people who can retire and be in the mentorship program. I found with much data that it was hard to read all of it. I would like to put this in python to .loc possible and narrow the data. Overall sql was easier to write in and create the data to come up with my concuslion.
